**Project: RC Buggy**

**Building an RC Buggy**

Summary:

Im going to build a remote controlled buggy for fun since I have never built any hardware with such complexity before. Im using a kit as it contains a lot of parts at 
a fairly reasonable rate and since it bundles up a lot of them. Looking for all of the parts separately would take a lot of time and would also go over budget. This
is also my first time doing such a project thus this would be more beneficial. Additional products like the batteries, radios, wheels, etc. I'll buy separately since
they are not included in the kit

Plan:

1)Initially, I'll test whether the electronics are compatible.

2) I'll assemble all the hardware and hopefully it works


**Budget**

Conversion Factor: $1 = ₹82.92
(Not too sure about shipping for the kit, doesn't show. Original price is $126.99 but im leaving some breathing room for shipping.)
